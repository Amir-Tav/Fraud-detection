# Fraud Detection using Autoencoder

This project applies an unsupervised Autoencoder model to detect fraudulent transactions within a dataset. Autoencoders are ideal for anomaly detection tasks, such as fraud detection, because they learn compressed representations of data, allowing the identification of outliers through reconstruction error.

## Project Overview
- **Goal**: To develop a model that can accurately identify potentially fraudulent transactions based on reconstruction errors using an Autoencoder neural network.
- **Dataset**: Transactions data containing features related to financial transactions, where each entry is labeled as either legitimate or fraudulent.

## Contents of the Notebook

### 1. Data Loading and Preparation
- **Data Import**: The dataset is loaded, and libraries such as Pandas and Numpy are imported.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Initial analysis to understand class distribution and identify any class imbalance.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
  - Handling missing values (if any) and standardizing/normalizing features for model compatibility.
  - Data is split into training and testing sets, ensuring a fair distribution of classes.

### 2. Building the Autoencoder Model
- **Model Structure**: A neural network with three main components:
  - **Encoder**: Reduces the input dimension, learning key features.
  - **Bottleneck**: Central, compressed layer where essential information is retained.
  - **Decoder**: Reconstructs the input from compressed information.
- **Compilation**: The model is compiled with Mean Squared Error loss, commonly used for reconstruction tasks.

  ```python
  # Sample code for Autoencoder architecture
  model = Sequential([
      Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
      Dense(16, activation='relu'),
      Dense(32, activation='relu'),
      Dense(input_dim, activation='sigmoid')
  ])
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')
  ```

### 3. Model Training
- **Training Process**: The model is trained on non-fraudulent transactions to learn typical patterns, using a validation set to track reconstruction error.
- **Epochs and Early Stopping**: To prevent overfitting, training is monitored with early stopping.

### 4. Model Evaluation and Fraud Detection
- **Reconstruction Error**: Transactions are passed through the Autoencoder, and reconstruction error is calculated. Higher errors indicate anomalies (possible fraud).
- **Thresholding**: Based on reconstruction error, a threshold is set to distinguish between normal and anomalous transactions.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **Precision**: Measures how many identified fraud cases are actual frauds.
  - **Recall**: Measures the coverage of actual fraud cases detected.

  ```python
  # Calculating reconstruction error and applying threshold
  reconstruction_error = np.mean(np.square(X_test - model.predict(X_test)), axis=1)
  threshold = np.percentile(reconstruction_error, 95)  # Example threshold based on 95th percentile
  ```

### 5. Results and Analysis
- **Performance**: Metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall provide insight into the model's effectiveness in distinguishing fraudulent from non-fraudulent transactions.
- **Observations**: Discusses strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.

## Usage
To run this notebook:
1. Ensure required libraries (TensorFlow, Numpy, Pandas) are installed.
2. Load the notebook and execute each cell sequentially.
3. Adjust the threshold value based on specific needs or dataset characteristics.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of Autoencoders in fraud detection, utilizing unsupervised learning to detect anomalies without labeled data. With fine-tuning, Autoencoder-based anomaly detection offers a flexible approach to identify rare events, such as fraud.
